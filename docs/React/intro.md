# Introduction to React

React is a javascript library for building user interfaces. It is Component-based, Declarative, State-driven.

**Component-based** : These are the building blocks of User interfaces in React.  
**Declarative** : Tell React what the component should look like based on current data/state.  
**State-Driven** : React renders elements depending on the data present. Data is also called as state.

It is coded using JSX, a syntax that combines HTML, CSS, JavaScript as well as referencing other React components.


It is a javascript library as it only contains the view layer. We need to add other packages/dependencies to complete a full-stack application.
