# Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is a high-level language, object oriented, multi paradigm, just-in time compiled, dynamic, single-threaded programming language with first class functions and a non-blocking event loop concurrency model.

**High-level**: The resources are automatically allocated and with the help of a garbage collector disposed off.  
**Object oriented** : Based on objects except primitves.  
**Multi paradigm** : Procedural, Functional , OOPS concepts can be used  
**Just-in time complied**: It means the code is compiled during execution and not ahead of time.
**Dynamically typed**: Simply means we do not have to manually define the data type of the value stored. it is taken care of by the compiler.  
**First class functions**: Everything is treated as variables i.e functions can be passed as variables and return them.  
**Non blocking eventloop concurrency model**: Runs on single thread, so code is executed one line at a time. It uses an event loop that takes long running tasks and puts them in the background till execution and later puts it on the main thread.
