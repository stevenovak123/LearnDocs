These are all my **personal** learnings/ notes made by me for the topics. These are not a general notes for a topic.

## Tech Stack

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Local development

This environment is fully on computer and requires each dependency to be installed and set up, but gives you the most flexibility for customisation.

#### Prerequisites

Before contributing or adding a new feature, please make sure you have already installed the following tools:

- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (Works with Node LTS version)
- yarn - a package manager built by Facebook

#### Commands

You can set this up locally with the following steps:

1. `yarn install`
1. `yarn start`

this will start the project on your local development server. Then make your changes and raise PR to the project.
